This is just a basic script I wrote a long time ago to go through an entire directory structure, hash every file that meets a certain criteria (ie. has the right extensions), store it somewhere persistent, and compare them to root out duplicates. It's not very sophisticated or elegant or anything really, just something that does it's job and nothing more.

The current version is a mildly more sophisticated version of the original. Mainly in the form of fancy pants command line options so you don't need to edit the file every time you want to go through a different directory structure for example. Just run it and it'll tell you how to use it.

As far as compatibility goes I haven't exactly gone to great lengths to test that kind of stuff. I know it works on OS X and Linux, so I guess as long as you have Python 2.7 installed you shouldn't run into problems I guess. Don't know about Windows though, as I don't have a machine running it readily available so I can't test it.
